Move from found to fixed when fixed.

BUGS FOUND

After colliding with the streaker, the NPC will run in a circle.


BUGS FIXED

Animation switches continue from the last frame index instead of restaring. Ex: If running ends at frame 4, then falling will start at 5.

Character state should be called streaker state, and should be in streaker class.

Logic of keyboard input to movement result needs to be fixed. Streaker should check keyboard state using input manager, input manager should not tell the streaker what to do.
